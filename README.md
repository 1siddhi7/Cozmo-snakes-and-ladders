# Cozmo-snakes-and-ladders

This repository includes the details of my ongoing project to make [Cozmo](https://www.anki.com/en-us/cozmo) play the board game "Snakes and Ladders".

[Here] is the python implementation of the same.

In this implementation, I have defined functions for Cozmo to move from initial position to final position taking into consideration the constraints of snakes and ladders. One drawback of this implementation is that error keeps on accumulating as Cozmo moves forward. As an upcoming work, I plan to improve Cozmo's accuracy during its movements on the board.
